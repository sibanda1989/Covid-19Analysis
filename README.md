# Covid 19 Analysis

I used this python notebook together to clean source data on Covid 19 using libraries such as pandas and numpy.

## Wrangling the Data

Data was obtained in the form of a csv file from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) website. This data detailed statistics like infections, deaths, vaccinations for countries across the world. I cleaned it up to remove duplicates and dropping unnecessary column before exporting the clean csv for further analysis in a BI tool, I used Tableau in this case.

## Key Insights

Some interesting insights came up in the Analysis:

- Covid deaths were negatively correlated to a country's GDP. Countries with higher GDPs saw lesser death rates per infections than those with low GDPs.
- Covid infections were positively correlated to population density. Countries with high population densities experienced higher infection rates, with the exception of China
